Description
-----------

*Django Admin addon to navigate through hierarchies.*

Have you ever wanted Django Admin to be able to navigate through hierarchies?

Without existing models modifications? Yeah!

Admirarchy does it in an old-school way, just like Norton Commander and Co - one level at a time.

Hierarchies described as adjacency lists and nested sets are supported.


.. code-block:: python

    # admin.py of your application
    from django.contrib import admin

    from admirarchy.toolbox import HierarchicalModelAdmin

    from .models import MyModel  # Let's say this model represents a hierarchy.


    # Inherit from HierarchicalModelAdmin instead of admin.ModelAdmin
    @admin.register(MyModel)
    class MyModelAdmin(HierarchicalModelAdmin):

        hierarchy = True  # This enables hierarchy handling.


Done. Go navigate %)
