Description
-----------

*Django Admin addon to navigate through hierarchies.*


Have you ever wanted Django Admin to be able to navigate through hierarchies?

Without existing models modifications? Yeah!

Admirarchy does it in an old-school way, just like Norton Commander and Co - one level at a time.

Hierarchies described as adjacency lists and nested sets are supported.


Requirements
------------

1. Python 3.6+
2. Django 1.8+
3. Django Admin contrib
